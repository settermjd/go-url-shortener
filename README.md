# Go URL Shortener

This is a small, simplistic example of creating a URL shortener in Go.

## Requirements

To use this application, you will need the following:

- [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) **or** PHP 8.1 with the [PDO](https://www.php.net/manual/en/pdo.installation.php) and [PDO_PGSQL](https://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.pdo-pgsql.php) extensions and [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) 14 or above.
- Your favourite IDE or code editor
- [Go](https://go.dev/dl/) 1.19 or above

## Usage

First, clone the project to a directory on your local machine by running the following command:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:settermjd/go-url-shortener.git go-url-shortener
```

Then, start the application, using Docker Compose by running the following command in the top-level directory of the project.

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

**Note:** The first time that you run the command, if you donâ€™t have one or more images in your local Docker cache, then they have to be downloaded.
This shouldn't take too long, allowing for the speed of your internet connection.

**New to Docker Compose and want a hand getting started?**
Then grab a copy of my free book: [Deploy with Docker Compose](https://deploywithdockercompose.com/).
